        </div>
        <div>
        <p>The Club picked up well and the learners were able to learn a lot.
            <h2 class="header2">OBJECTIVES:</h2>
            <p>We had two main objectives clearly spelt out for this term as indicated below and I'm pleased to report that we achieved the objectives.</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                <li>The Introduction to Coding</li>
                <li>Pragramming with Scratch</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <p>Through them, we were able to develop our first animated computer game, dubbed, <span class="strong">"The Falling Game".</span> All our learners, right from Grade Two to Grade Six are able to recreate the game on their own without any assistance.</p>
        <p>Next term will be a deep dive into <span class="strong">Scratch</span> and <span class="strong">Introduction to Programming with Python.</span></p>

        <p>We are closing the term with a register of 18 members (as captured below)and we project that the number will double up come next term owing to the many request we received from the pupils.</p>

        <div>
            <p>Here's the membership list.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2 class="header2">RECOMMENDATIONS:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>We kindly request for two days of Club's day.That is <span class="strong">Wednesdays and Fridays</span>This is because, Coding and Programming are very intensive thus require much time to connect and grasp the concept. In view of this, we recommend that the charges be Ksh.3500 per child for those two days.</p>

        <p>We thank the school Administartion for agreeing with our request to start the club and we wholeheartedly appreciate the support accorded to us so far.</p>
